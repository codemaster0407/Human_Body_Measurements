# Human_Body_Measurements
Finding the human body measurements from a 3d model.
The 3d model is generated from a open source code. In this project, we determined the circumference of chest, waist, shoulder, biceps.
We used blender (bpy) library to find the circumference. The edge length was estimated by one 3d model and was used on the other models. Error analysis will be done later.
